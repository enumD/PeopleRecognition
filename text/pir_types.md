## 1. HC-SR501  
Main Features:
This is one of the most popular and affordable PIR sensors.
Good detection range (up to about 7 meters with a 120° detection zone).
Has a digital output, allowing you to read the sensor's state (high or low).
Powered by 5V DC.
Easy to use with Raspberry Pi or Arduino.
Pros: Affordable, widely used, easily available.

Cons: Limited range, sensitivity not precisely adjustable (but can be adjusted via a potentiometer on the module).

Where to Buy: Amazon, AliExpress, or online electronics stores.

$ 3 euro each

## 2. AM312  
Main Features:

A miniaturized PIR sensor compared to other models.
Compact and energy-efficient.
Detects motion up to 3-5 meters.
Excellent for applications in tight spaces.
Pros: Compact and low power consumption.


Cons: Shorter detection range compared to models like the HC-SR501.

Where to Buy: Amazon, AliExpress.

$ 2-3 euro each

## 3. PIR Motion Sensor Module (KY-022)  
Main Features:

Low-cost module.
Detects motion up to 5-7 meters.
Sensitivity adjustable via a potentiometer.
Easy to integrate with microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
Pros: Adjustable sensitivity, good detection range.

Cons: Sensitivity can be variable depending on orientation and temperature.

Where to Buy: Amazon, AliExpress, or online electronics stores.

$ 4 euro each

## 4. RCWL-0516 (Microwave Sensor)   

Main Features:

This sensor is not a PIR sensor but a microwave sensor that detects motion using microwaves.
Has a much longer detection range (up to 10-15 meters).
Works even in low light conditions and is not affected by temperature.
Adjustable sensitivity.
Pros: Longer range than PIR sensors, unaffected by temperature.

Cons: Variable sensitivity, may be more expensive than a PIR sensor.

Where to Buy: Amazon, AliExpress, electronics stores.

$ 2.5 euro each and maybe it's not necessary to point directly 

## 5. Panasonic EKMC1601111  
Main Features:

High-sensitivity PIR sensor.
Good detection range (up to 8 meters).
Used for industrial and commercial applications.
Easily integrated with microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
Pros: High sensitivity and good range.

Cons: More expensive than basic PIR sensors like HC-SR501.

Where to Buy: Amazon, electronics distributors like Digi-Key or Mouser.

$ 10-11 euro each


# Which one?  
The camper is outside: sun, rain and atmosferic agent represent an hard environment.  
PIR sensors suffer (src chatgpt):  
**Direct sunlight**: can cause a lot of false positives or false negatives because the sunlight can interfere with the sensor’s ability to distinguish between the heat emitted by a person and the heat of surrounding objects (such as the ground or the vehicle).   
**Thermal Interference**:In some cases, a hot surface (like a sun-heated car or camper) can emit enough infrared radiation that the PIR sensor can't distinguish it from a person, leading to incorrect readings.  

PIR sensors suffer a lot with direct sunligth, i can install the sensors on the external roof of the camper and point them down the sides, this could reduce the possibility to have direct sunlight throught them.  
Another option could be to install the sensors under the camper, under the bumper or better inside the bumper like the car's professional ones. With the microwave sensor maybe i can
